        <h3>This Classic Tomato Soup is rich with a velvety texture. It’s easy to make with canned tomatoes, and perfectly suited for all of your grilled cheese dipping needs. Better than a can of Campbell's and just about as easy!</h3>
        <p>Tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches are best when the air turns crisp, the mornings are damp, and the days are short. The soup’s simplicity only accentuates its role as a tincture on a cold fall evening. Its velvety texture is a robe of warmth. </p>
        <p>This recipe is as easy as dumping soup from a can, but makes more servings and tastes much better. </p>

            1 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 1/2 teaspoons of cracked black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 can diced tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 can tomato sauce
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>

    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
               <h4>Sauté the onions and garlic: </h4> 
               <p>In a Dutch oven set over medium heat, add the butter. Once it starts to foam, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Stir until both have softened and are fragrant, about 7 minutes. </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Make the roux:</h4>
                <p>Add flour. Stir to make a paste. Continue stirring until the flour has taken on a light brown color. Stir and scrape with wooden spoon, 5-7 minutes. The onion paste should look golden with a little brown caramelization. </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Add tomatoes and stock:</h4>
                <p>Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, chicken stock, and sugar. Stir to combine. Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce heat to medium and let simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Purée and serve: </h4>
                <p> Purée the soup with an immersion blender. Alternatively, fill a countertop blender less than halfway with the hot soup. Remove the center lid insert. This allows the hot steam to escape. Cover the hole with a folded kitchen towel and place your hand over the top. Blend. Repeat as necessary until all of the soup has been puréed. </p>
                <p>Ladle into bowls, topped with freshly cracked pepper, slivered basil, and of course, grilled cheese sandwiches. </p>
