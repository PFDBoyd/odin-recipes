    <h3>Buttered noodles with real Parmesan cheese, parsley, and butter are an easy and delicious recipe with pantry staples you already have on hand. Great for quick lunches and no-fuss dinners!</h3>
    <p>Who doesn't love buttered noodles? The only problem I have with them is that I can easily eat them all if they're set before me. </p>
    <p>This recipe calls for egg noodles, which are classic for buttered noodles. But, the beauty of buttered noodles is that you can use almost any dried, unstuffed pasta you have in your pantry, following the cooking directions on the package. Try some of these other pasta shapes. </p>
